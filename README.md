  Expanding personal vocabulary with spaced repetition approach.
  > Spaced repetition is a method of reviewing material at systematic intervals. At the beginning of the
  learning process, the intervals are spaced closely together (for example, one hour; four hours; one
  day). As the material is reviewed, the intervals become systematically longer (four days; one week;
  two weeks). An ideal system of spaced repetition allows you to review the material before it is
  forgotten, helping you to retain it in your long term memory.
